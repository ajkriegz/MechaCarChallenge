# Purpose
This analysis uses R to review production data on the MechaCar for insights that may help the manufacturing team with production troubles.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![resources/mpg_regression.png]

* The variables that seem to provide a non-random amount of variance to mpg values in this dataset are vehicle length and ground clearance.

* The slope of this linear model can be considered not zero because the p-value is much smaller than assumed significance levels, showing that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

* The r-squared value is over .7, meaning this model can be considered an accurate predictor of MechaCar prototypes. 

## 

Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots

## 

Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

## 

Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
