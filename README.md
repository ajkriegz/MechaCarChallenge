# Purpose
This analysis uses R to review production data on the MechaCar for insights that may help the manufacturing team with production troubles.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![resources/mpg_regression.png]

* The variables that seem to provide a non-random amount of variance to mpg values in this dataset are vehicle length and ground clearance.

* The slope of this linear model can be considered not zero because the p-value is much smaller than assumed significance levels, showing that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

* The r-squared value is over .7, meaning this model can be considered an accurate predictor of MechaCar prototypes. 

## 

Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## 

Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

## 

Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
